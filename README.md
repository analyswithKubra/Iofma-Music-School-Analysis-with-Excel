# Iofma Music School Dashboard Overview 

## Why I Chose This Project

I worked at IOFMA Music School as a data analyst, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. As the only person working with data, I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with instructors and the school owner. They weren’t just my colleagues—they were my team, helping me understand the nuances of the data.

Throughout this journey, I worked on many exciting projects. One day, I asked the school owner if I could create a dashboard using the school's name and some concepts I worked on during my time there. To my delight, they said yes!

This is the story behind my Excel Music School Dashboard, inspired by my time at IOFMA Music School. If you’re curious to know more about this wonderful school or even join a music class, feel free to visit them—you might find something perfect for you!

## Where My Project Data Comes From

As mentioned in my story, this project is inspired by IOFMA Music School. However, due to privacy concerns and the competitive nature of the market, I did not use real data. Instead, I generated similar data using tools like ChatGPT, Faker, and Python.

This data was carefully designed to replicate realistic patterns and insights while respecting the privacy of the school. With the school’s permission, I am sharing this data so others can learn and create their own perspectives. If you decide to use this data, please share your projects with me—I’d love to learn from your creativity!

## What Is My Purpose With This Project?

My primary goal was to showcase my Excel skills through this project. However, I always choose projects that excite me and provide value to others. This wasn’t just a portfolio project for me—it was a way to create something that could genuinely help someone make decisions about their company or school. I approached this project with the mindset of solving real-world challenges, pouring all my energy into ensuring it’s both practical and insightful.
